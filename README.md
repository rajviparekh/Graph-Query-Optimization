# A Novel Approach for Query Optimization in Graph Databases

## Overview
This project introduces an efficient framework for **query optimization in graph databases**, addressing the challenge of handling complex queries on large-scale graph data. Our approach enhances performance by employing **query decomposition**, **metadata-based indexing**, and **multi-threading**, ensuring faster and more accurate query execution.

## Objectives
- Develop an optimization framework for graph database queries.
- Implement query decomposition to divide complex queries into sub-queries.
- Utilize metadata extraction for efficient data retrieval and indexing.
- Enhance performance using multi-threading techniques.

## Methodology
1. **Query Decomposition:**  
   - Complex queries are broken down into smaller sub-queries to improve processing efficiency.
   
2. **Metadata Utilization:**  
   - A constraint graph is generated at runtime to filter unnecessary data chunks and optimize search space.
   
3. **Parallel Processing:**  
   - Multi-threading is employed to execute sub-queries concurrently, enhancing performance.
   
4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Benchmarking against Neo4j, measuring query execution time and resource utilization.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Query Execution:** Optimized decomposition and processing pipeline.
- **Constraint-Based Search:** Reduced data scanning through intelligent filtering.
- **Benchmarking & Comparison:** Performance tested against Neo4j for validation.

## Implementation
- **Technologies Used:**  
  - **Graph Database:** Neo4j  
  - **Programming Language:** Python  
  - **Benchmarking Tools:** Performance metrics for query execution
